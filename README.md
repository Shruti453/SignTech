Sign Language Detection 
This repository contains 3 ipynb files

create_data_gesture: It uses OpenCV to help develop your own dataset
dataflair_trainCNN: It uses keras model to train your dataset to the corresponding classes.
model_for_gesture: It taken in real time frames and predict the sign language to English digits.
The h5 files, contour_sign_detection, is the trained model (which is the technique used for analysing the hand in front)
gesture is the dataset containing testing and training data for contours. The dataset has around 3400 images.
